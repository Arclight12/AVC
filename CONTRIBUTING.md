# Contributing to ATS

This repository contains research-oriented components with modular architecture.  
Contributions should follow these principles:

- Maintain abstraction where appropriate.
- Avoid introducing model-specific, device-specific, or dataset-specific assumptions.
- Ensure all modules remain interchangeable.
- Document changes clearly.
- Do not submit proprietary or sensitive data.

Pull requests will be reviewed for consistency, modularity, and architectural neutrality.
